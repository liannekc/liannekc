<h1>Hi there, I'm Lianne! 

<h5>I am currently a technology consultant who's looking to deepen her technical skills! Here, you'll find some projects that I've worked on quite a few years back when I was first introduced into the world of data analytics. You'll also find some new projects I'm newly working on as I dive back into the world of data and all its wonders. Cheers!
